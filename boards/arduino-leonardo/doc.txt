@brief       Support for the Arduino Leonardo board

## Overview
The Arduino Leonardo is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4.

Similar to an Arduino UNO, can be recognized by computer as a mouse or keyboard.
Otherwise it's the same. Brief descriptions of both boards are available at
the official [Arduino web site.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Boards)

It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and
12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a
power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed
to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB
cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

For details, please look at the [Leonardo page.](@ref boards_arduino-leonardo)

## Using the shell
The shell is using the TTL (5V) serial because the USB (CDC) communication is
not currently supported.

The TTL serial cable must be connected as described below:
- FTDI RX goes to PIN1 (TX)
- FTDI TX goes to PIN0 (RX)
- FTDI GND goes to GND

## Flashing the device
Flashing RIOT on the Arduino Leonardo is quite straight forward, just
connect your Arduino Leonardo using the programming port to your host computer,
push the reset button (the amber led must blink) and type:

`make BOARD=arduino-leonardo flash-only`

This should take care of everything!
