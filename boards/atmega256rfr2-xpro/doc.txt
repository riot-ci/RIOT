@brief       Support for the Atmega256RFR2 Xplained Pro board

### General information

The [Atmega256RFR2 Xplained Pro](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATMEGA256RFR2-XPRO)
is an evaluation kit by Microchip for their ATmega256RFR2 microcontroller.

### Flash the board

You can flash the board using the on-board EDBG programmer via JTAG. Avrdude has
support for programming an AVR via EDBG with its xplainedpro programmer:

```
make BOARD=atmega256rfr2-xpro -C examples/hello-world flash
```

### Accessing STDIO via UART

STDIO can be accessed through the USB connector. The on-board UART-USB
adapter is not affected by flashing. It shows up as /dev/ttyACM0 on Linux.
It will be used automatically with `make term`:
```
make BOARD=atmega256rfr2-xpro -C examples/hello-world term
```
