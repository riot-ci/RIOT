@brief       Support for the stm32f103c8 based blackpill board.

## Overview
This board can be bought very cheaply on sides like eBay or
AliExpress. Although the MCU nominally has 64 KiB ROM, most of them
have 128 KiB ROM. This board is almost identical to the @ref boards_bluepill
except for the pin layout and the on board LED is connected to PB12 instead
of PC13. For more information see:
http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Black_Pill

To avoid duplication of the documentation, please refer to the documentation of
the @ref boards_bluepill instead.

## Using 128KiB Flash

Similar to the @ref boards_bluepill, the full 128KiB flash can be used (at your
on risk) using:

    make BOARD=blackpill-128kib flash
