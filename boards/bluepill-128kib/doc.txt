@brief       Support for the stm32f103cb based bluepill board.

This board is identical to the @ref boards_bluepill, but it allows you to flash
128KiB. The Bluepill is equipped with an STM32F103C8 which officially only has
64KiB flash. However, it appears that most STM32F103C8 seem to be an
STM32F103CB with only a fuse blown and therefore have fully function 128KiB
flash. So - on your own risk - this boards provides you with a way to use the
full 128KiB.

In order to avoid duplication of the documentation, please refer to the
documentation of the regular @ref boards_bluepill instead.
