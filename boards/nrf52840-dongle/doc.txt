@brief       Support for the nRF52840-Dongle

### General information

The [nRF52840-Dongle)
is a bare USB-stick shaped device that houses barely anything than the
nRF52840 itself, which offers BLE and 802.15.4 connectivity.

Unlike similar sticks (like the @ref boards_nrf52840-mdk), it features no
dedicated programmer hardware but relies on direct USB communication with a
built-in bootloader.

The board features two LEDs (green, RGB), a user and a reset button as well as
15 extrnal pins.

### Flash the board

The board is flashed using its on-board boot loader; the
[nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil) program needs to
be installed to turn the binary into a suitable zip file and send it to the
bootloader.

The bootloader can be entered by pressing the board's reset button, and
indicates readiness by pulsing LED2 in red.

### Accessing STDIO via USB

This board has no UART connected via a hardware or programmer USB-UART; USB
terminal functionality can only be obtained using USBUS.

This is work in progress.
