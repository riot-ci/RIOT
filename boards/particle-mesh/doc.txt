@brief       Support for the Particle Mesh boards family (Xenon, Argon, Photon)

### General information

[Particle Mesh](https://www.particle.io/mesh/) are mesh-ready development kits.
Depending on the board type (Xenon, Argon, Boron), it provides access to
multiple communication protocols: BLE, 802.15.4, WiFi, LTE.

This support is generic to the 3 types of Particle Mesh development kits:
the 3 boards share the same design with extra hardware for some of them.
Using this extra hardware (ESP32, LTE) with RIOT is as easy as including the
corresponding driver module to an application (note that this extra hardware is
not supported yet).

### Flash the board

Using the [Particle Mesh debugger](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/accessories/mesh-accessories/#debugger),
the board can be flashed with PyOCD programmer via a DAPLink.

PyOCD can be installed using Python package manager:
```
    pip install pyocd --user -U
```

To flash the board, use `BOARD=particle-mesh` with the `make` command.<br/>
Example with `hello-world` application:
```
    make BOARD=particle-mesh -C examples/hello-world flash
```

In this case, OpenOCD can also be used. For the moment, the latest stable
version of OpenOCD (0.10) doesn't contain any support for nrf52 but versions
built against the actual development version can be used.

To flash the board with OpenOCD, use the `PROGRAMMER` variable:
```
    PROGRAMMER=openocd make BOARD=particle-mesh -C examples/hello-world flash
```

### Accessing STDIO via UART

The STDIO is not accessible via the USB port.

To access the STDIO of RIOT, a FTDI to USB converter needs to be plugged to
the RX/TX pins on the board.
