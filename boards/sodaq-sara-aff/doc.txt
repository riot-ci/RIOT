)
 *
 * ### Flash the board
 *
 * Use `BOARD=sodaq-sara-aff` with the `make` command.<br/>
 * Example with `hello-world` application:
 * ```
 *      make BOARD=sodaq-sara-aff -C examples/hello-world flash
 * ```
 *
 * @note     If the application crashes, automatic reflashing via USB, as explained
 *           above won't be possible. In this case, the board must be set in
 *           bootloader mode by double tapping the reset button before running the
 *           flash command.
 *
 * ### Accessing STDIO via UART
 *
 * STDIO of RIOT is directly available over the USB port.
