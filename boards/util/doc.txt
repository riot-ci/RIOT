@brief       Support for using the RIOT build system to build native utilities

# Overview

While the @ref boards_native is aimed at simulating hardware and using as
much of RIOT as possible, the `util` dummy board does the opposite.

It attempts to use as little RIOT code as possible to build a native application,
just leveraging the RIOT build system to build utilities that make use
of RIOT libaries or packages.

There is no attempt made to simulate any hardware.
All libraries of the host operating system are available.
