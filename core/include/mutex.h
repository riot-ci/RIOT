 *
 * Mutex Implementation Basics
 * ===========================
 *
 * Data Structures and Encoding
 * ----------------------------
 *
 * A `mutex_t` contains basically a point, which can have one of the following
 * values:
 *
 * 1. `NULL`, in case it is unlocked
 * 2. `MUTEX_LOCKED` in case it is locked, but no other thread is waiting on it
 * 3. A pointer to the head of single linked list of threads (or more precisely
 *    their `thread_t` structures) blocked waiting for obtaining the mutex. This
 *    list is terminated by `NULL`, not by `MUTEX_LOCKED`
 *
 * The same information graphically:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Unlocked mutex:
 * +-------+
 * | Mutex | --> NULL
 * +-------+
 *
 * Locked mutex, no waiters:
 * +-------+
 * | Mutex | --> MUTEX_LOCKED
 * +-------+
 *
 * Locked mutex, one waiter:
 * +-------+     +--------+
 * | Mutex | --> | Waiter | --> NULL
 * +-------+     +--------+
 *
 * Locked mutex, 2 waiters:
 * +-------+     +--------+     +--------+
 * | Mutex | --> | Waiter | --> | Waiter | --> NULL
 * +-------+     +--------+     +--------+
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Obtaining a Mutex
 * -----------------
 *
 * If a `mutex_lock()` is called, one of the following happens:
 *
 * 1. If the mutex was unlocked (value of `NULL`), its value is changed to
 *    `MUTEX_LOCKED` and the call to `mutex_lock()` returns right away without
 *    blocking.
 * 2. If the mutex as a vale of `MUTEX_LOCKED`, it will be changed to point to
 *    the `thread_t` of the running thread. The single item list is terminated
 *    be setting the `thread_t::rq_entry.next` of the running thread to `NULL`.
 *    The running thread blocks as described below.
 * 3. Otherwise, the current thread is inserted into the list of waiting
 *    threads sorted by thread priority. The running thread blocks as described
 *    below.
 *
 * In case 2) and 3), the running thread will mark itself as blocked (waiting
 * for a mutex) and yields. Once control is transferred back to this thread
 * (which is done in the call to `mutex_unlock()`), it has the mutex and the
 * function `mutex_lock()` returns.
 *
 * Returning a Mutex
 * -----------------
 *
 * If `mutex_unlock()` is called, one of the following happens:
 *
 * 1. If the mutex was already unlocked (value of `NULL`), the call returns
 *    without modifying the mutex.
 * 2. If the mutex was locked without waiters (value of `MUTEX_LOCKED`), it is
 *    unlocked by setting its value to `NULL`.
 * 3. Otherwise the first `thread_t` from the linked list of waiters is removed
 *    from the list.
 *     - This thread is the one with the highest priority, as the list is sorted
 *       by priority.
 *     - This thread's status is set to pending and its added to the appropriate
 *       run queue.
 *     - If that thread was the last item in the list, the mutex is set to
 *       `MUTEX_LOCK`.
 *     - The scheduler is run, so that if the unblocked waiting thread can
 *       run now, in case it has a higher priority than the running thread.
