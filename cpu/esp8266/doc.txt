@brief           Port of RIOT-OS to Espressif's ESP8266/ESP8285 MCUs

There are two implementations that can be used:

- the **SDK version** which is realized on top of an SDK (esp-open-sdk or ESP8266_NONOS_SDK) and
- the **non-SDK version** which is realized without the SDK.

The non-SDK version produces a much smaller code size than the SDK version and is more efficient in excecution because it does not need to run additional SDK functions to keep the SDK system alive.

The **non-SDK** version is probably the **best choice if you do not need the built-in WiFi module**, for example, when you plan to connect the MCU to an IEEE 802.15.4 radio module for communication.

By default, the non-SDK version is compiled. To compile the SDK-version, add option ```SDK=1``` to the make command, e.g.,

    make flash BOARD=esp8266-esp-12x -C test/shell SDK=1 ...

Please refer file $(RIOTBASE)/cpu/esp8266/README.md for more information about the toolchain, supported features and compile options.
