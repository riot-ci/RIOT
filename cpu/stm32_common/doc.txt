 * STM32F[2|4|7] Clock configuration
 * =================================
 *
 * stm32f2, stm32f4 and stm32f7 cpus share clock configuration code and macro.
 * It can be configured as described here.
 *
 * The following macro must be defined in the board's periph_conf.h:
 *  - CLOCK_HSE: 0 if HSI must be used as PLL source, frequency in Hz otherwise,
 *  - CLOCK_LSE: 0 if LSI must be used as low speed clock, 1 otherwise
 * (the LSE is a 32.78kHz crytal)
 *  - CLOCK_CORECLOCK: desired main clock frequency
 *  - CLOCK_AHB_DIV, CLOCK_AHB: AHB prescaler in register value and AHB frequecny in Hz
 *  - CLOCK_APB1_DIV, CLOCK_APB1: APB1 prescaler in register value and APB1 frequecny in Hz
 *  - CLOCK_APB2_DIV, CLOCK_APB2: APB2 prescaler in register value and APB2 frequecny in Hz
 *
 * The following macro are optional and can be defined depending on board config
 * and application needs:
 *  - P: P is the PLL output divider. The default value is 2, but depending on
 * board configuration, it can be overriden. (Possible values: 2,4,6,8)
 *  - PLL_IN_FREQ: PLL input frequency, this value must be between 1 and 2 MHz.
 * The default value is 2MHz for even value of input clock, 1MHz otherwise.
 *
 *  - CLOCK_ENABLE_PLLI2S: if a second PLL (PLL I2S) is available on the cpu, it
 * can be activated with this macro.
 *  - CLOCK_I2S: if the PLL I2S is used, this is the PLL output frequency (default: 48MHz)
 *  - Q_I2S: PLL I2S output divider. If not defined, the value is automatically
 * calculated.
 *
 *  - CLOCK_ENABLE_PLLSAI: if a second PLL (PLL SAI) is available on the cpu, it
 * can be activated with this macro.
 *  - CLOCK_SAI: if the PLL SAI is used, this is the PLL output frequency (default: 48MHz)
 *  - Q_SAI: PLL SAI output divider. If not defined, the value is automatically
 * calculated.
 *
 *
 * @note the PLL I2S or SAI may be automatically activated if the 48MHz output cannot be
 * genrated by the main PLL with the given CLOCK_CORECLOCK, P and CLOCK_HSE values and
 * if the cpu support to drive 48MHz clock from one of these PLLs
 *
 * Clock outputs can also be setup with macro:
 *  - CLOCK_MCOx_SRC, CLOCK_MCOx_PRE, with x=1,2: MCO1 and MCO2 output configuration
 * macros. CLOCK_MCOx_SRC defines the MCOx source, as a register value (see vendor header),
 * CLOCK_MCOx_PRE defines the MCOx prescaler, as a register value.
 *
 * Others PLL values (M, N, Q) are calculated automatically from output clock
 * (CLOCK_CORECLOCK for main PLL, CLOCK_I2S for PLL I2S), PLL input clock (PLL_IN_FREQ,
 * used for both PLLs) and P (only for main PLL).
