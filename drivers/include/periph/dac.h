 * @defgroup    drivers_periph_dac DAC
 * @ingroup     drivers_periph
 * @brief       DAC peripheral driver interface
 *
 * Similar to the ADC driver interface (@ref drivers_periph_adc), the DAC
 * interface uses the concept of lines, corresponds to a tuple of a DAC device
 * and a DAC output channel.
 *
 * The DAC interface expects data to be served as a 16-bit unsigned integer,
 * independent of the actual resolution of the hardware device. It is up to the
 * DAC driver, to scale the given value to the maximal width that can be
 * handled. The device driver should, on the other hand, implement the DAC in a
 * way, that it will use the bit width, that comes closest to 16-bit.
 *
 * This kind of 'auto-scaling' is quite sufficient for this interface, as
 * standard DAC peripherals use a fixed conversion resolution internally anyway,
 * so that any particular bit-width configuration on this driver level would not
 * have much effect...
 *
 * # (Low-) Power Implications
 *
 * The configured DAC peripherals are active (and consume power) from the point
 * of initialization. When calling dac_poweroff(), the implementation **should**
 * disable the given DAC line and put the DAC peripheral to sleep (e.g. through
 * peripheral clock gating). When woken up again through dac_poweron(), the
 * given DAC line **should** transparently continue it's previous operation.
 *
 * The DAC driver implementation may need to block (and free) certain power
 * modes in the driver's dac_init(), dac_poweron(), and the dac_poweroff()
 * functions.
