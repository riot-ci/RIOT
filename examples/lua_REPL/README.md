### About

This example shows how to write IoT applications using Lua.

### Caveats

Currently, the only actual function available is "print"

### How to use

Put your lua code into "main.lua" (check the example). The file will
automatically be included when compiling the application. You can then execute the
file using the lua_run_script command.

### How to run

Type `make flash term

Note: you may have to press `RESET` on the board (after the flash) if the board
reboots faster than the terminal program can start..
