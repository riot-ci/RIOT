## Decawave TWR_ALOHA Example

This example allows testing different two-way ranging algorithm between
two boards supporting a dw1000 device. This makes use of the uwb-core
pkg. This example is based on the twr-aloha example in
[uwb-apps](https://github.com/Decawave/uwb-apps/tree/master/apps/twr_aloha).

### Setup

1. Flash one node as the tag (Default configuration)

    $ make -C examples/twr_aloha/ flash term

2. Flash the second node as an anchor

    $ DW1000_ROLE=0x4 make -C examples/twr_aloha/ flash term

3. On the tag node begin ranging, you will see ranging estimations where
the "raz" field is "range" in meters.

4. Trying different ranging algorithms

The method for ranging used is selected by modifying the mode variable
in the uwb_ev_cb function in main.c. By default, it will use one of the
modes available and setting the `mode` variable accordingly.

If multiple modes are enabled it will switch among them, to use only
one algorithm compile as follows:

    $ UWB_FIXED_TWR_ALGORITHM=UWB_DATA_CODE_SS_TWR make -C examples/twr_aloha/ flash term

The different algorithm options are:

- UWB_DATA_CODE_SS_TWR
- UWB_DATA_CODE_SS_TWR_EXT
- UWB_DATA_CODE_SS_TWR_ACK
- UWB_DATA_CODE_DS_TWR
- UWB_DATA_CODE_DS_TWR_EXT
