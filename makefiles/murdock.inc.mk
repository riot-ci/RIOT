#
# This file contains helper targets used by the CI.
#
#
# This target will run "make test" on the CI cluster.
#
# In order to work, these requirements must be fulfilled:
# - DWQ_REPO and DWQ_COMMIT are set correctly
# - the user has set up autossh & proper authentication for connecting to the CI
# (intended to be used by CI only for now)
#
# By default, $(FLASHFILE) is copied to the test worker along with the job.
# If the test needs any extra files, they can be added to the TEST_EXTRA_FILES
# variable. They will also be sent to the test worker *and placed in the
# application's BINDIR*.
