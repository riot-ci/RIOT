/**
 * @defgroup pkg_lua Lua ported to RIOT
 * @ingroup  pkg
 * @brief    Provides a Lua interpreter for RIOT
 * @see      https://github.com/lua/lua
 * @see      sys_lua
 *
 * # Customizations
 *
 * The upstream Lua code is used without modification, with the following
 * exceptions:
 *
 * - lua.c (the main interface to the interpreter) is replaced by our own
 *   stripped-down version. The REPL is no longer included.
 * - loadlib.c (the "package" module) is replaced by our own (simplified)
 *   loader. All the code dealing with files and dynamic loading has been
 *   removed.
 *
 */

/* These are docs for the future */
/*
 * # Running Lua and C code
 *
 * see \ref sys_lua for information on how to access RIOT modules from within
 * Lua.
 *
 * While it is possible to include your application specific modules and run
 * arbitrary Lua code only just using this interpreter, the \ref sys_lua module
 * provides an automated way of handling Lua modules.
 *
