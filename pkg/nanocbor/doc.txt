 * @brief    CBOR encoder and decoder library for tiny devices
 *
 * This package contains the NanoCBOR library for a small CBOR encoder and
 * decoder. Flash footprint for encoding and decoding should be below 1K each.
 *
 * At the moment 8 bit and 16 bit MCU support is broken by upstream, see the
 * [issue](https://github.com/bergzand/NanoCBOR/issues/18).
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Just add it as a package in your application:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEPKG += nanocbor
 * ```
 *
 * @see      https://github.com/bergzand/nanocbor
