/**
 * @defgroup    sys_matstat Matstat - Integer mathematical statistics library
 * @ingroup     sys
 * @brief       Library for computing 1-pass statistics
 *
 * The Matstat library uses single pass algorithms to compute statistic measures
 * such as mean and variance over many values. The values can be immediately
 * discarded after processing, keeping the memory requirement constant
 * regardless of how many values need to be processed.
 *
 * The design goal is to provide basic mathematical statistics operations on
 * constrained devices with a "good enough" accuracy to be able to provide some
 * descriptive measures of data. For more accurate measures of statistics, use a
 * fancier library, or copy the data to a PC.
 *
 * It is important to know that using integer operations will result in lower
 * precision in the computed measures because of truncation.
