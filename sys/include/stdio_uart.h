/**
 * @defgroup    sys_stdio_uart STDIO over UART
 * @ingroup     sys
 *
 * @brief       Standard input/output backend using UART
 *
 * @warning Standard input is disabled by default on UART. To enable it, load
 *          the `stdin` module in your application:
 * ```
 * USEMODULE += stdin
 * ```
 *
 * @attention   Using STDIO over UART from interrupt context is not officially
 *              supported
 *
 * For testing purposes and using STDIO within an ISR should mostly work good
 * enough and for some platforms even reliable. Production code however should
 * fully avoid any access to STDIO from interrupt context. Instead, e.g. an
 * event could be posted to an @ref sys_event and the actual STDIO operation
 * being deferred to thread context.
 *
 * Some reasons why RIOT does not officially support STDIO over UART from ISR:
 * 1. UART is *slow* and the system easily remains in interrupt context for
 *    unacceptable long time.
 * 2. An UART implementation might choose to not guard an atomic sequence of
 *    interactions with the hardware by disabling IRQs but using a mutex, e.g.
 *    because the sequence takes long. Locking a mutex from interrupt
 *    context will result in a deadlock, if the mutex is already locked.
 * 3. If an ISR is triggered from a power saving mode, some peripherals or
 *    clock domains might still be offline during that ISR; including the UART
 *    peripheral. This is a valid implementation choice to allow time critical
 *    low power scenarios being covered by RIOT.
