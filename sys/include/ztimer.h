 * @brief       High level timer abstraction layer
 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * ztimer provides a high level abstraction of hardware timers for application
 * timing needs.
 *
 * The basic functions of the ztimer module are ztimer_now(), ztimer_sleep(),
 * ztimer_set() and ztimer_remove().
 *
 * They all take a pointer to a clock device (or virtual timer device) as first
 * parameter. RIOT provides ZTIMER_USEC, ZTIMER_MSEC, ZTIMER_SEC by default.
 * These clocks allow multiple timeouts to be scheduled. They all provide 32bit
 * range.
 *
 * ztimer_now() returns the current clock tick count as uint32_t.
 *
 * ztimer_sleep() pauses the current thread for the passed amount of clock
 * ticks. E.g., ```ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_SEC, 5);``` will suspend the currently
 * running thread for five seconds.
 *
 * ztimer_set() takes a ztimer_t object (containing a function pointer and
 * void* argument) and an interval as arguments. After at least the interval
 * (in number of ticks for the corresponding clock) has passed, the callback
 * will be called in interrupt context.
 * A timer can be cancelled using ztimer_remove().
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * #include "ztimer.h"
 *
 * static void callback(void *arg)
 * {
 *    puts(arg);
 * }
 *
 * int main()
 * {
 *     ztimer_t timeout = { .callback=callback, .arg="Hello ztimer!" };
 *     ztimer_set(ZTIMER_SEC, &timeout, 2);
 *
 *     ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_SEC, 5);
 * }
 *
 *
 * # Design
 *
 * ## clocks, virtual timers, chaining
 *
 * The system is composed of clocks (virtual ztimer devices) which can be
 * chained to create an abstract view of a hardware timer/counter device. Each
 * ztimer clock acts as a filter on the next clock in the chain. At the end of
 * each ztimer chain there is always some kind of counter device object.
 *
 * Each clock device handles multiplexing (allowing multiple timers to be set)
 * and extension to full 32bit.
 *
 * Hardware interface submodules:
 *
 * - @ref ztimer_rtt_init "ztimer_rtt" interface for periph_rtt
 * - @ref ztimer_rtc_init "ztimer_rtc" interface for periph_rtc
 * - @ref ztimer_periph_init "ztimer_periph" interface for periph_timer
 *
 * Filter submodules:
 *
 * - @ref ztimer_convert_frac_init "ztimer_convert_frac" for fast frequency
 *   conversion using the frac library
 * - @ref ztimer_convert_muldiv64_init "ztimer_convert_muldiv64" for accurate
 *   but slow frequency conversion using 64bit division
 *
 *
 * A common chain could be:
 *
 * 1. ztimer_periph (e.g., on top of an 1024Hz 16bit hardware timer)
 * 2. ztimer_convert_frac (to convert 1024 to 1000Hz)
 *
 * This is how e.g., the clock ZTIMER_MSEC might be configured on a specific
 * system.
 *
 * Every clock in the chain can always be used on its own. E.g. in the example
 * above, the ztimer_periph object can be used as ztimer clock with 1024Hz
 * ticks in addition to the ztimer_convert_frac with 1000Hz.
 *
 *
 * ## Timer handling
 *
 * Timers in ztimer are stored in a linked list for which each entry stores the
 * difference to the previous entry in the timer (T[n]). The list also stores
 * the absolute time on which the relative offsets are based (B), effectively
 * storing the absolute target time for each entry (as B + sum(T[0-n])).
 * Storing the entries in this way allows all entries to use the full width of
 * the used uint32_t, compared to storing the absolute time.
 *
 * In order to prevent timer processing offset to add up, whenever a timer
 * triggers, the list's absolute base time is set to the *expected* trigger
 * time (B + T[0]). The underlying clock is then set to alarm at (now() +
 * (now() - B) + T[1]). Thus even though the list is keeping relative offsets,
 * the time keeping is done by keeping track of the absolute times.
 *
 *
 * ## Clock extension
 *
 * The API always allows setting full 32bit relative offsets for every clock.
 *
 * In some cases (e.g., a hardware timer only allowing getting/setting smaller
 * values or a conversion which would overflow uint32_t for large intervals),
 * ztimer takes care of extending timers.
 * This is enabled automatically for every ztimer clock that has a "max_value"
 * setting smaller than 2**32-1. If a ztimer_set() would overflow that value,
 * intermediate intervals of length (max_value / 2) are set until the remaining
 * interval fits into max_value.
 * If extension is enabled for a clock, ztimer_now() uses interval
 * checkpointing, storing the current time and corresponding clock tick value on
 * each call and using that information to calculate the current time.
 * This ensures correct ztimer_now() values if ztimer_now() is called at least
 * once every "max_value" ticks. This is ensured by scheduling intermediate
 * callbacks every (max_value / 2) ticks (even if no timeout is configured).
 *
 *
 * ## Reliability
 *
 * Care has been taken to avoid any unexpected behaviour of ztimer. In
 * particular, ztimer tries hard to avoid underflows (setting a backend timer
 * to a value at or behind the current time, causing the timer interrupt to
 * trigger one whole timer period too late).
 * This is done by always setting relative timeouts to backend timers, with
 * interrupts disabled and ensuring that very small values don't cause
 * underflows.
 *
 *
 * ## Configuration and convention
 *
 * As timer hardware and capabilities is diverse and ztimer allows configuring
 * and using arbitrary clock backends and conversions, it is envisioned to
 * provide default configurations that application developers can assume to be
 * available.
 *
 * These are implemented by using pointers to ztimer clocks using default names.
 *
 * For now, there are:
 *
 * ZTIMER_USEC: clock providing microsecond ticks
 *
 * ZTIMER_MSEC: clock providing millisecond ticks, using a low power timer if
 *              available on the platform
 *
 * ZTIMER_SEC:  clock providing second time, possibly using epoch semantics
 *
 * These pointers are defined in `ztimer.h` and can be used like this:
 *
 *     ztimer_now(ZTIMER_USEC);
 *
 *
 * ## Differences to xtimer
 *
 * - the addition of a "clock" parameter makes it possible to work with
 *   multiple differently clocked timers and backends
 *
 * - the API is 32bit only
 *
 * - much of ztimer can be unittested on a mock clock
 *
 * - the internal timer list uses relative timers and thus doesn't need 64bit
 *   arithmetic or storage
 *
 * - ztimer_extend extends <32bit timers in an ISR safe way
 *
 * - has much reduced number of configuration tunables (no XTIMER_BACKOFF,
 *   XTIMER_ISR_BACKOFF)
 *
 * - ztimer always executes callbacks in ISR context, whereas xtimer might
 *   trigger very short timers in ISR context
