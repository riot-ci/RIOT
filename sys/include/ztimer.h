 * @brief       High level timer abstraction layer
 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * ztimer provides a high level abstraction of hardware timers for application
 * timing needs.
 *
 * The basic functions of the ztimer module are ztimer_now(), ztimer_sleep(),
 * ztimer_set() and ztimer_remove().
 *
 * They all take a pointer to a clock device (or virtual timer device) as first
 * parameter. RIOT provides ZTIMER_USEC, ZTIMER_MSEC, ZTIMER_SEC.
 * These clocks allow multiple timeouts to be scheduled. They all provide 32bit
 * range.
 *
 * ztimer_now() returns the current clock tick count as uint32_t.
 *
 * ztimer_sleep() pauses the current thread for the passed amount of clock
 * ticks. E.g., ```ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_SEC, 5);``` will suspend the currently
 * running thread for five seconds.
 *
 * ztimer_set() takes, a ztimer_t object (containing a function pointer and
 * void* argument) and an interval as arguments. If the interval (in number of
 * ticks for the corresponding clock) has passed, the callback will be called
 * in interrupt context.
 * Such a timer can be cancelled using ztimer_remove().
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * #include "ztimer.h"
 *
 * static void callback(void *arg)
 * {
 *    puts(arg);
 * }
 *
 * int main()
 * {
 *     ztimer_t timeout = { .callback=callback, .arg="Hello ztimer!" };
 *     ztimer_set(ZTIMER_SEC, &timeout, 2);
 *
 *     ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_SEC, 5);
 * }
 *
 *
 * # Design
 *
 * ## clocks, virtual timers, chaining
 *
 * The system is composed of clocks (virtual ztimer devices) which can be
 * chained to create an abstract view of a hardware timer/counter device. Each
 * ztimer clock acts as a filter on the next clock in the chain. At the end of
 * each ztimer chain there is always some kind of counter device object.
 *
 * TODO: Add block diagram figures
 *
 * Hardware interface submodules:
 *
 * - @ref ztimer_rtt_init "ztimer_rtt" interface for periph_rtt
 * - @ref ztimer_periph_init "ztimer_periph" interface for periph_timer
 *
 * Filter submodules:
 *
 * - @ref ztimer_extend_init "ztimer_extend" for hardware timer width extension
 * - @ref ztimer_convert_init "ztimer_convert" for frequency conversion
 *
 * A common chain could be:
 *
 * 1. ztimer_periph (e.g., on top of an 1024Hz 16bit hardware timer)
 * 2. ztimer_convert (to convert 1024 to 1000Hz)
 * 3. ztimer_extend (to restore the full 32bit)
 *
 * This is how e.g., the clock ZTIMER_MSEC might be configured on a specific
 * system.
 *
 *
 * ## Timer handling
 *
 * Timers in ztimer are stored in a linked list for which each entry stores the
 * difference to the previous entry in the timer (T[n]). The list also stores
 * the absolute time on which the relative offsets are based (B), effectively
 * storing the absolute target time for each entry (as B + sum(T[0-n])).
 * Storing the entries in this way allows all entries to use the full width of
 * the used uint32_t, compared to storing the absolute time.
 *
 * In order to prevent timer processing offset to add up, whenever a timer
 * triggers, the list's absolute base time is set to the *expected* trigger
 * time (B + T[0]). The underlying clock is then set to alarm at (now() +
 * (now() - B) + T[1]). Thus even though the list is keeping relative offsets,
 * the time keeping is done by keeping track of the absolute times.
 *
 * ## Differences to xtimer
 *
 * - the addition of a "clock" parameter makes it possible to work with
 *   multiple differently clocked timers and backends
 *
 * - the API is 32bit only
 *
 * - much of ztimer can be unittested on a mock clock
 *
 * - the internal timer list uses relative timers and thus doesn't need 64bit
 *   arithmetic or storage
 *
 * - ztimer_extend extends <32bit timers in an ISR safe way
