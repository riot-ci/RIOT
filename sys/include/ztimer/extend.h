/**
 * @defgroup  sys_ztimer_extend ztimer_extend counter width extender
 * @ingroup   sys_ztimer
 * @brief     Extends a counter to a 32 bit virtual counter.
 *
 * Provides a monotonic virtual 32 bit clock by wrapping another clock, which
 * can be of any smaller width, using checkpointed interval partitioning.
 *
 * ### Theory of operation
 *
 * The underlying clock range is split into multiple equal length intervals
 * called partitions. The underlying alarm target is never scheduled further
 * into the future than the length of one partition. This behaviour prevents the
 * ambiguity in how the software should interpret the counter values in relation
 * to setting alarm targets.
 *
 * An internal state is used to keep track of the 32 bit virtual alarm target,
 * some internal flags, and the 32 bit offset from the underlying clock.
 *
 * #### Checkpointing
 *
 * A checkpoint is updated every time the underlying counter is read by the library.
 * The virtual clock offset is updated whenever the underlying counter transitions
 * into a new partition.
 *
 * #### Long timeouts
 *
 * When an alarm target is requested which is further into the future than the
 * entire width of the underlying timer, the wrapper will set successive
 * partition length alarms on the underlying clock until the target is within
 * reach of the underlying timer.
 *
 * #### Race conditions
 *
 * The checkpoint function may be run from multiple threads, and is therefore
 * sensitive to data races. The implementation uses atomic operations to ensure
 * that threads do not interfere with each other. This solution may cause
 * additional calls to the @ref ztimer_ops_t::now "now" method on the underlying
 * timer because of retries when a data race is detected.
